## Data

### Maps

The mapping libraries and tiles are provided by [MapBox](http://mapbox.com/). Mapbox uses open data from [OpenStreepMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) and its contributors.

### Earthquake Data

The earthquake data was retrieved from the [ANSS Composite Catalog](http://quake.geo.berkeley.edu/cnss/) and joined with the [Centennial Catalog](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/data/centennial.php) from the [USGS](http://www.usgs.gov/). Thanks to the USGS, to the  Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) for providing the catalog and to the [Northern California Earthquake Data Center (NCEDC)](http://quake.geo.berkeley.edu/) and to the organizations that contributed the data to the NCEDC.
